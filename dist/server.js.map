For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\n  (0, _inherits3.default)(BeforeAfterWrapper,
